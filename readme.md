# Hybrid Tabs

This plugin has been retired.  I've replaced it with a much better plugin.  Check out [Whistles](http://wordpress.org/plugins/whistles), which allows you to create tabs, toggles, and accordions.

Thank you to all the supporters of this plugin over the years.

## Forks

If you'd like to fork this plugin or even take over the project altogether, let me know.  I can get someone to pass the plugin over to you on [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/hybrid-tabs) as well.
